### Calculate how much water contained by jth glasses - Amazon
```
Problem
There are some glasses with equal volume 1 litre. The glasses kept as follows

            1
          2   3
       4    5    6
     7    8    9   10
   
You can put water to only top glass. If you put more than 1 litre water to 1st glass, 
water overflow and fill equally both 2nd and 3rd glass. Glass 5 will get water from 
both 2nd glass and 3rd glass and so on.. 

If you have X litre of water and you put that water in top glass, so tell me how much 
water contained by jth glass in ith row. 

Example. If you will put 2 litre on top. 
1st – 1 litre 
2nd – 1/2 litre 
3rd - 1/
